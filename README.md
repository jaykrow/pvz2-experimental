# **Overview**

Experimental library containing a lot of PvZ2 hooks for 9.4.

# **IMPORTANT**
None of this code follows best practices and several features are unfinished, so keep that in mind as you read through or if you use the implementation. For example, a lot of destructors aren't overridden so memory leaks can happen for a lot of custom types.
